Problem 2: 
The population of town A is less than population of town B. 
However, the population of town A is growing faster than the population of town B. 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the population and growth rate of each town. 
The program outputs after how many years the population of town A will be greater than or
equal to the population of town B and the populations of both the towns at that time. 
(A sample input is: Population of town A =5,000, 
growth rate of town A =4%, Population of town B =8,000, growth rate of town B =2 %.)
Hint: You have to have growth rate as double and population as integerâ€¦.

Problem 3: 
(Apartment problem)  A real estate office handles , say, 50 apartment units. 
When the rent is, say, $600 per month, all the units are occupied. 
However, for each, say $40 increase in rent, one unit becomes vacant. 
Moreover, each occupied unit requires an average of $27 per month for maintenance.
How many units should be rented to maximize the profit?
Write a program that prompts the user to enter:
	a.	The total number of units. 
	b.	The rent to occupy all the units.
	c.	The increase in rent that results in a vacant unit. 
	d.	Amount to maintain rented unit.
The program then outputs the number of units to be rented to maximize the profit.
